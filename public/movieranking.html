<h1> The Best Movies According to Foluso </h1>
<h2> My top 3 movies of all-time. </h2>
<hr/>
<h3> Pariah </h3>
<p> It was refreshing to see a Black take on LGBTQ. Even more refereshing because the main 
    character , who is a lesbian, is originally Nigerian.
</p>
<h3> Benedetta</h3>
<p> This one is scandalous & religiously so. There is just something quite notorious and troublesome 
    abut lesbian nuns and I find that exciting. 
</p>
<h3> From Zero to I love you </h3>
<p> Eh, this one was okay. It was a previously married white man with a black guy so interracial couple.
    The black guy was heartbreakingly fine though. MMmmmn.
